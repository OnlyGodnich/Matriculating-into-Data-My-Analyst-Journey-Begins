# Matriculating-into-Data-My-Analyst-Journey-Begins
Hereâ€™s where it all began my first footprint in data analytics. Born not from trend, but from passion. The joy of solving, the thrill of discovery, the beauty of turning raw numbers into meaning. This portfolio is my purpose in motion. #DataJourney #PassionDriven. 

 From mastering Excel to querying with SQL, and now crafting my portfolio each phase has shaped the analyst I am becoming

 ## Project Topic: Bike Purchase Analysis

 ### Projet Overview
This project explores the behavioral patterns behind bike purchases using Excel. By analyzing demographic, economic, and lifestyle data including income, age, marital status, education, commute distance, and more. I uncovered key trends that influence consumer decisions. Each visualization and pivot table tells a story: why a young professional might delay purchase, or how commute distance correlates with ownership. The goal was not just to analyze, but to humanize the data transforming raw numbers into actionable, relatable insights. This project marks a foundational step in my data journey, where storytelling meets structured analysis

### Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a publicly available resource provided by Alex The Analyst, a respected voice in the data community. Sourced from one of his Excel project tutorials, the dataset serves as a practical foundation for exploring real-world business scenarios, allowing for hands-on analysis and storytelling through data

### Data Analysis and Preparation 
In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparation, we perform the following action;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing Variables and Duplicates
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as ;

- How does income level impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
- What demographic factors most influence bike purchase decisions?
- Is there a relationship between commute distance and bike ownership?
- Do lifestyle factors like home ownership, car ownership, and region affect bike purchase?

### Data Analysis


This is where i include some basic lines of code, Queries or even some DAX expressions used during my analysis


``` SQL
SELECT Region
WHERE Region = Europe

```
