 ## Project Topic: Bike Purchase Analysis

 ### Projet Overview
This project explores the behavioral patterns behind bike purchases using Excel. By analyzing demographic, economic, and lifestyle data including income, age, marital status, education, commute distance, and more. I uncovered key trends that influence consumer decisions.

The goal was not just to analyze, but to humanize the data transforming raw numbers into actionable, relatable insights. This project marks a foundational step in my data journey, where storytelling meets structured analysis
